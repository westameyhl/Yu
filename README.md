# Acceleration-Angle-Displacement Calculation Module Ver.1.0
Multi-Segment Unit Shape Function Estimation System

Acceleration-Angle-Displacement Calculation Module.
The model is divided into multiple segments, and the displacement shape function of the linear elements is estimated based on angular measurement data.
The example calculation is based on a 1D simply supported beam. However, since it is essentially a mathematical model under a specific physical framework, it can be adapted to various scenarios by setting appropriate boundary conditions.
By modifying the parameters in the setting folder, the calculation conditions can be changed.
